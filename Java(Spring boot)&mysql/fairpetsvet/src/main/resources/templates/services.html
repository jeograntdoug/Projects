												   Annual check up <i class="fas fa-sort-down"></i></h2>
												   <p class="dropdown-content">
												   A comprehensive annual physical exam (checkup) is the best way to keep your pet healthy. Our
												   veterinarians will examine your animal from head to tail and discuss preventive measures
												   tailored to your pet’s lifestyle. The annual checkup is a good time to raise any concerns and
												   ask questions about your pet. The clinic is equipped with a full-service laboratory, so we can
												   get blood test results right away for urgent diagnoses. Our medical team can handle even the
												   most advanced cases requiring hospitalization or critical around-the-clock care (intravenous
												   fluids, advanced therapies), all within our office.

												   <h2><img src="/images/services/icon_service_osteopathie.jpg" alt="osteopathy-icon">Osteopathy <i class="fas fa-sort-down"></i></h2>
												   <p class="dropdown-content">
												   The osteopathic treatments can be used as well for the prevention of injury with active pets
												   (ex: agility, cani-cross) and for the treatment of acute or chronic conditions (arthrosis,
												   locomotor problems, growth problems, gastro-intestinal problems, kidney insufficiency,
												   behavioural issues, dermatologic problems etc.), We can also use osteopathy after a surgery to
												   help reduce the amount of adhesions caused by the healing tissue, as well as giving back optimal
												   mobility to the area in question. The main purpose of this approach is to be able to give your
												   pet a treatment that will complement what traditional medicine can provide. Most patients accept
												   and tolerate the manipulations very well since they are gentle and adapted for each animal.

												   <h2><img src="/images/services/icon_service_chirurgie.jpg" alt="surgery-icon">Surgery and anesthesia <i class="fas fa-sort-down"></i></h2>
												   <p class="dropdown-content">
												   Pet surgeries are performed by a veterinarian assisted by a veterinary technician. We do a
												   pre-anesthetic physical exam and blood test so we can develop a surgical plan specific to each
												   patient. We take every precaution to ensure anesthesia is administered correctly and we
												   continually monitor your pet’s heart rate, body temperature, blood pressure, and other vital
												   signs.

												   <h2> <img src="/images/services/icon_service_dentisterie.jpg" alt="dental-icon">Dental care <i class="fas fa-sort-down"></i></h2>
												   <p class="dropdown-content">Your pet’s oral health is very important. Regular dental care (scaling
												   and polishing) is
												   recommended to reduce the risk of infection and detect abnormalities that may be causing your
												   pet pain. Monkland Veterinary Clinic is fully equipped to clean your animal’s teeth and perform
												   extractions if needed. We also use a digital x-ray machine, thereby limiting exposure and
												   anesthesia time. Your pet must be completely immobilized during these procedures, so they have
												   to be placed under general anesthesia.</p>

												   Microchipping <i class="fas fa-sort-down"></i></h2>
												   <p class="dropdown-content">
												   A microchip is a small, electronic chip enclosed in a glass cylinder that is about the same size
												   as a grain of rice. The microchip itself does not have a battery—it is activated by a scanner
												   that is passed over the area, and the radiowaves put out by the scanner activate the chip. The
												   chip transmits the identification number to the scanner, which displays the number on the
												   screen. The microchip itself is also called a transponder.

												   Radiographie <i class="fas fa-sort-down"></i></h2>
												   <p class="dropdown-content">
												   We have a state of the art DR digital xray machine that allows us to take images quickly and efficiently, giving immediate image preview. Digital Radiology also allows us the ability to digitally transfer and enhance images. We also offer OFA and Penn Hip speciality radiographs for breeders.
